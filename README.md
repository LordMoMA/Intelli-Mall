## Viewing the monitoring data

Clicking on one of the rows in the graph will provide you with additional details. 

## The Prometheus UI

We also have the metrics to check out in Prometheus at `http://localhost:9090`

## Grafana UI for more compelling intepretation - Intelli Mall App Dashboard

Opening `localhost:3000/` and then browsing for dashboards will show the two dashboards that are installed under the intellimall folder.

![Screenshot of OpenTelemetry Collector dashboard](https://github.com/LordMoMA/Intelli-Mall/assets/67067729/03e64fbc-6eff-40ee-a89b-9e3d8a13771f "Screenshot of OpenTelemetry Collector dashboard")

How much activity you see in the dashboard will depend on how many clients you have running in the busywork application and the random interactions that the clients are performing.

## How does Terminal reflect the events:
